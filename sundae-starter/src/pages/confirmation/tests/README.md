# Test Documentation for OrderConfirmation Component

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `OrderConfirmation` component in a React application, focusing specifically on handling error responses from a server when submitting an order.

## Test Setup

### Imports

- `render, screen`: Imported from `../../../test-utils/testing-library-utils` to render the component and access DOM queries for asserting conditions in tests.
- `server`: Imported from `../../../mocks/server` to manipulate server responses during testing.
- `HttpResponse, http`: These are imported from `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to mock network responses.

### Component

- `OrderConfirmation`: This component is responsible for handling the final confirmation step of placing an order.

## Test Description

### Code

```jsx
test("error response from server for submitting order", async () => {
  // override default msw response for options endpoint with error response
  server.resetHandlers(
    http.post("http://localhost:3030/order", () => {
      return new HttpResponse(null, { status: 500 });
    })
  );

  render(<OrderConfirmation />);

  const alert = await screen.findByRole("alert");
  expect(alert).toHaveTextContent(
    "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
  );
});
```

### Test: Error Response from Server for Submitting Order

#### Description:

This test checks how the `OrderConfirmation` component handles receiving an error response from the server during the order submission process.

#### Key Methods:

- `server.resetHandlers()`: This function from `msw` is used to override the default server handlers to simulate an API error response specifically for this test scenario.
- `render()`: Renders the `OrderConfirmation` component into the virtual DOM.
- `screen.findByRole()`: Retrieves elements by their accessible role, used here to find an alert that is expected to appear upon an error.
- `expect().toHaveTextContent()`: Asserts that the alert contains specific text indicating an error was encountered.

#### Scenario Tested:

- **Simulated Server Error**: The test simulates a server error by setting the response status to 500 when the order submission endpoint is called. This is intended to test the component's error handling capabilities, ensuring it displays an appropriate message to the user when things go wrong.
